# Pax
## What is it?
**A moderation bot I made with someone because I'm bored. It has basic kick, ban, mute commands and much more.**
## Invite: 
The bot asks for all permissions apart from administrator so that you can choose what channels it can see, it also asks to be able to create slash commands so it is ready fr discordpy 2.0's slash command compatibility. The inviite: [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=857672808162918410&permissions=4294967287&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1&response_type=code&scope=bot%20guilds.join%20applications.commands)
